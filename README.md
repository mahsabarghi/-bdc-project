# Big Data Computing Project 2020-2021
## Mobile Health Human Behavior Analysis
### Human activity classification
## Task Summary
The MHEALTH (Mobile HEALTH) dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of the diverse profiles while performing several physical activities. Sensors placed on the subject's chest, right wrist, and left ankle are used to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, acceleration, rate of turn, and magnetic field orientation. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements, which can be potentially used for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias, or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. In this project, only acceleration and gyroscope data will be used for the classification of the given activity.
